1. **Define the Macro**:
   - Create a new macro file, e.g., `macros/cents_to_dollars.sql`.
   - Use Jinja syntax to define the macro: `{% macro cents_to_dollars(column_name) -%}`.
   - **Mechanics**: Jinja macros in dbt allow you to encapsulate reusable SQL logic. The macro is defined with a name and parameters, similar to a function in programming.

2. **Implement Conversion Logic**:
   - Inside the macro, implement the conversion logic: `round(cast(({{ column_name }} / 100) as numeric), 2)`.
   - **Mechanics**: 
     - `{{ column_name }}`: Jinja syntax to dynamically insert the column name passed as an argument.
     - `column_name / 100`: Divides the value by 100 to convert cents to dollars.
     - `cast(... as numeric)`: Converts the result to a numeric type for precision.
     - `round(..., 2)`: Rounds the numeric value to two decimal places for currency formatting.

3. **Close the Macro Definition**:
   - End the macro with `{%- endmacro %}` to signify the end of the macro block.
   - **Mechanics**: The `-{%` and `%}-` delimiters help manage whitespace in Jinja, ensuring clean SQL output.

4. **Invoke the Macro in a Model**:
   - In a dbt model, replace hardcoded conversion logic with the macro invocation: `{{ cents_to_dollars('column_name') }}`.
   - **Mechanics**: 
     - The macro call is replaced with the macro's SQL logic during dbt's compilation phase.
     - This allows for dynamic SQL generation, where the macro logic is applied to the specified column.

5. **Compile and Execute with dbt**:
   - Run `dbt run` to compile the SQL models and execute them against the database.
   - **Mechanics**: 
     - dbt compiles the model files, expanding macros into their defined SQL logic.
     - The compiled SQL is executed against the target database, applying the transformation.

6. **Verify Output**:
   - Ensure that the columns converted using the macro reflect the correct dollar values.
   - **Mechanics**: 
     - The output should show values in dollars, confirming the macro's logic was applied correctly.
     - This step involves checking the database or dbt's output logs for correctness.

7. **Review and Optimize**:
   - Consider adding logic to handle edge cases, such as negative values or nulls, within the macro.
   - **Mechanics**: 
     - Enhancing the macro to handle edge cases ensures robustness and reliability across different datasets.
     - This might involve adding conditional logic or additional SQL functions within the macro.

8. **Maintain Consistency Across Models**:
   - Apply the macro consistently across different models to ensure uniform conversion logic.
   - **Mechanics**: 
     - Using the macro across models centralizes the conversion logic, making it easier to update and maintain.
     - This practice reduces redundancy and potential errors in SQL code.
