1. **Test Declaration**:
   - Define the test in a YAML configuration file associated with a model or column.
   - Specify the test type (e.g., singular, generic) and any necessary parameters.
   - **Example**: In `customers.yml`, declare a test using `dbt_utils.expression_is_true` to check a logical condition.

2. **Test Definition**:
   - For custom tests, create a SQL file in the `tests` directory.
   - Write SQL logic that identifies records violating the test condition.
   - **Example**: A SQL file `order_total_greater_than_subtotal.sql` checks if `order_total` is less than `subtotal`.

3. **Test Compilation**:
   - When you run `dbt test`, dbt compiles the test SQL files.
   - The SQL logic is expanded and prepared for execution against the database.

4. **Test Execution**:
   - dbt executes the compiled SQL queries on the target database.
   - Tests are run in parallel, similar to model execution, to improve efficiency.

5. **Result Collection**:
   - dbt collects the results of each test, identifying any failures.
   - A test fails if the SQL query returns any rows, indicating a violation of the test condition.

6. **Review and Debugging**:
   - Review the test results in the console or logs to identify failing tests.
   - Use the output to investigate data issues and refine model logic or data sources.

7. **Iteration and Improvement**:
   - Based on test results, iterate on the test logic or add new tests to cover additional scenarios.
   - Regularly update tests to maintain data quality and integrity as the project evolves.
